           <p>We buy the best quality oils we can lay our hands on and regularly perform internal smell tests to ensure they are the best possible matches available to us. We have even held public, blind smell tests and results have always come up positive with the vast majority unable to tell the difference between Fine Fragrance Collection generic perfumes and their original designer versions (Usually, the only difference noticed is in the strength and we know why â€“ we have a much higher dosage)</p>

           <p>We realised that there was immense potential within nails and nail care products, as well as in niche products for the eye area. This market was being neglected by stores, and there was inadequate dialogue between end consumers and store staff. Quite simply, there was a lack of knowledge about the products.

            An intense period of product development followed, and after an initial presentation to the market we achieved a striking result. We felt that we were on the right path and recorded a fantastic result in a short time on our home market in South Africa to the outer part of the country</p>
